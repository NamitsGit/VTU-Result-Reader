# School/University Report Card Reader
School/University Result Reader is a python application that can be used to read School/University report cards.
Most of the report cards today are usually generated in PDF format.
To work with the data present in these PDF report cards becomes extremely easy if we can extract it in its raw textual form and convert it into other iterable types like python dictionaries, which can be in turn converted into other types like xml, json, csv, etc.

The app used in this project is capable of supporting VTU(Visvesvaraya Technological University) Report cards, but the code is made highly adaptable to be able to work with many different types of report cards generated by various Educational Institutions as there is abundant information made available throughout the program by the use of comments.Customization can be carried out by making changes in the areas identified by the comments.
